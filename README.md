# Minio-OpenShift

This template deploys a private object store using [Minio](https://min.io/) in [Rahti](https://rahti.csc.fi/), CSC's OpenShift cluster. The template creates a single pod deployment for Minio, which uses PVC as a backend volume for storing data. PVC size is provided to template as parameters & existing PVC could be also used.
